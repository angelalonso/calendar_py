Errors solved:

### 403 - Insufficient permission

Was due to running the credentials part with SCOPES = 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendari.readonly'

Had to remove everything under ~/.credentials, then run origin (bear in mind that flags = argparse is not on my main program), and only then run the script normally

### 404 on quick add

??
