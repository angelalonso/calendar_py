- rename -DONE
- config file

- In order to test everthing once and for all:
  destroy Calendar
  create Calendar
  import in two parts - autorecognize cal name (no hardcoding)
  list - autorecognize cal name (no hardcoding)
  export

- Current Opts:
  readcsv(does not work?) |loadcsv|getID|newcal|clearcal|delcal|newevent|list|listcalendars|getID
- Desired Opts:
  status (default)
  list -> read current entries in gCal
  export -> list but save into a CSV
    needs some work 
  update -> compare existing IDs, add new, change needed
  export -> list but save into a CSV
  import_old -> current loadcsv + export to new format (one column per data + ID)
  import -> current loadcsv with new format, ask if auto update or not at the beginning
  listcalendars -> just shows all calendars for the user


- Purpose:
  - Add/Change after measuring into CSV
    - Update without touching existing
    - ONLY do the above
  - Eventually, automate the above



- Configuration should go on a file:

  - Calendar name

- First time of running credentials could be done in another Script, derived from origin.py
  - RUNME.py
  - test it

- Include the credentials in the github project safely.
